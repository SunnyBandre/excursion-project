# excursion-project
In this project, we will create a web page which advertises a product called “Excursion.” We will use growing toolset including HTML, CSS, Command Line Interface, Git, and GitHub.
The web page we’ll build advertises a mobile app which helps users record and share their experiences, so we’ll use video and landscape imagery to set the scene.
A landing page is a vital tool in marketing a product these days, and the goal will be to entice potential customers into using the product.
We’ll work with Git and GitHub on our local machines.
